===Dropout====
Dropout is a regularizationntechiqu foe reducing overfitting in neural 
netwoeks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. It is a very 
efficient way of performing model averaging with nerual networks.

=====Autograd======
One of the most inportant packages form pytorch is autograd 


======Validation Set=======
A validation set has basically the same rol as k-foldscrissvalidation witch is to determien withc of the parameters 
performes the best

=======MustCheck=======
AlexNet,

GoogLeNet
OverFeat,VGG
ResNet-20
VGGNet-16
Faster R-CNN , YOLO , single shot detector SSD
In order to overcome the known limitation of disease detection R-FCN(Region-based Fully Convolutional Network) , Faster R-CNN,
SSD cmbined with VGG net and ResNet  deep featrue extractions.The model consturcted out of R-FCN and ResNet-50 optained an
accuracy of 85.98%
 In order to overcome complex backgorund and multiple dises on the same leafe  Segmentattion was proposed as a firs step in the process.
CaffeNet was pre-trained on an ImageNet dataset and used as a classifier witha an overall accuracy of 96.3% in detecting
13 different types of disease. AUGUMENTATION AND pre-training of the networks is very important .
 MustCheck waht is Transfer learning .
 When using a "deep" stategy the pre-trained GoogLeNet achieved 99.35% on PlantVilage dataset
 Segmentattion and backgorund removal have a great impact .
 For smartphone application Inception V3 and MobileNet were tested and obtained and accuracyof 88.3% and 92% . Preprocessing like
 segmentation and cropping the image  was done .
 Another approach was to use genetic algorithms in order to select the parameters for SuportVectorMachine , approach that achived
 98.14%
 GAN architecture is use to generate data . GAN architecture is made out of 2 neural networks one that creates data and one that analizes
